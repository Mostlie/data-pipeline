# Repository structure
The trace gas processing pipeline is structured as follows. This is executed on the smaug interactive node of the University of Utah's CHPC. The following paths are relative to the base path `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/lin-group9/measurements/pipeline` -

1. `process_data.sh` is the shell scripting control layer called by cron that sets environment variables and executes necessary processing code.  
1. `run/stid.r` called in parallel and executes site-specific processing code.
1. `src/` contains the bulk of processing source code as R functions.  
1. `bad/` contains site/instrument specific bad data files for manual correction or removal of data. Changes are reflected at the qaqc and calibrated data levels.  
1. `config/` contains json configurations for data structure and site metadata.  
1. `.lock/` contains lock files in the form of `<site_id>.lock` to indicate active site processing and prevent duplicate execution.  


# Revising historic data
Changes in the historic datasets can be made using the `bad/` data text files. When a new commit is made, the historic record for the given site is reprocessed on the next run (every 5 minutes).


# Site metadata
Site metadata can be found in [config/site_config.csv](config/site_config.csv) and at [air.utah.edu](http://air.utah.edu).  


# Instrument naming conventions
Additional instrument metadata can be found in [config/data_config.json](config/data_config.json).

# QAQC flagging conventions
Numeric values are assigned to observations that meet certain automated or human identified criterion. The meaning of these identifiers are as follows.

Flag  | Description
------|-----------------
1     | Measurement data filled from backup data recording source
0     | Data passes all QAQC metrics
-1    | Data manually removed
-2    | System flush
-3    | Invalid valve identifier
-4    | Flow rate or cavity pressure out of range
-5    | Drift between adjacent reference tank measurements out of range
-6    | Time elapsed between reference tank measurements out of range
-7    | Reference tank measurements out of range
-8    | Cavity humidity out of range
