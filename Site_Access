Intermountain Medical Center (IMC)
The instrumentation is located on the top floor of the main medical tower. This floor is for mechanical needs and is internally referred to as the “Penthouse”.  You will need an escort from hospital security to access the floor. 
•	Address:
5121 S. Cottonwood Street, Tower 5
Murray, UT 84107
•	Access: 
Park in the visitor lot in front of the main hospital tower (#5) and walk through the main entrance.  Immediately after walking through the automatic doors you will see a solid wood door to the right labeled “Security”.  Knock on the door and wait for a security guard to answer and let them know you are from the University of Utah and need to access the instrumentation located in the Penthouse.  They will escort you through the secure doors and get you access to the elevator that gets you to the top floor.  If no one answers the door, the main receptionist desk is located immediately behind the security room and one of the nice people there can call security for you to get the escort. 
Once you get to the Penthouse and through the final secure door you no longer need security to be present. Note that all access doors to the mechanical room lock automatically, so if you need to leave that room for any reason (i.e. access roof), make sure to prop the door open. 
If you need access to the roof where the inlet is located ask the security escort as you are headed up to the Penthouse so they can unlock the hatch that access the roof.  
Bring all materials that you will need so you don’t have to make multiple trips requiring an escort each time.
